## Focus areas
Climate Change is without a doubt one of the most pressing issues of our time. Leverage data from the Weather Operations Center Geospatial Analytics engine (PAIRS) or bring your own data to tackle the impacts of climate change on our planet and communities. 

Build a solution or prototypes that help address climate change. Here are a few examples:

- sustainable water use ([starter kit](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Water-2021/))
- resilient agriculture ([starter kit](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Production-2021/))
- responsible production ([starter kit](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Production-2021/))
- Climate risk and impact (quantifying the risk to socioeconomic and natural systems of current and future climate change).

Make sure you have a clear user in mind! Your solution should provide users with information, recommendations and insights that are relevant to them and how climate change is impacting their community.

Examples include:
- Agricultural workers
- Fishing industry
- Low-income communities (lack of local resources, greater economic instability)
- General civilian population

## Eligibility

Graduate students, or advanced undergraduate students with experience or high interest in research, at least 18 years old and studying full- or part-time at any of the participating universities are eligible to participate. We will be asking you to form teams of 1-5 students. You can create a team among yourselves or join a team through the team-building Slack channel created for this event.

Participating universities
- [MIT]()
- [Stanford]()
- [ETH Zurich]()
- [EPFL]()
- [The University of Tokyo]()

## Timeline

## Submissions

Submissions must include at least one (1) IBM technology, data set or API, along with any other open source technology, to address the problem of climate change. Submissions may require additional research, but must have clear use case.

At the end of the challenge, we will expect from each team a brief 3 minute video detailing what you’ve created, a description for how you put it all together and who your project is intended to help, and a roadmap to show the judges where your project is going.

## Judging

The solutions should be such that they can be extended and expanded upon. You will be judged based on:
- Completeness and transferability
- Effectiveness and efficiency - positive impact to science or scientific research
- Design and usability
- Creativity and innovation

## Getting help

In the Slack workspace, you’ll be able to find other participants, join or build teams, brainstorm and collaborate on ideas, and communicate with the challenge Champions and Subject Matter Experts for mentoring and technical guidance.
