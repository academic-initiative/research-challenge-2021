## Focus areas
Climate Change is without a doubt one of the most pressing issues of our time. Leverage data from the Weather Operations Center Geospatial Analytics engine (PAIRS) or bring your own data to tackle the impacts of climate change on our planet and communities.

Build a solution or prototypes that help address climate change via:
- sustainable water use ([starter kit](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Water-2021/))
- resilient agriculture ([starter kit](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Production-2021/))
- responsible production ([starter kit](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Production-2021/))
- Climate risk and impact (quantifying the risk to socioeconomic and natural systems of current and future climate change).

For more details please look at our blog post

## Submissions

Submissions must include at least one (1) IBM technology, data set or API, along with any other open source technology, to address the problem of climate change. Submissions may require additional research, but must have clear use case.
Example technologies:
- [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant)
- [IBM Watson Machine Learning](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/machine-learning)
- [IBM Weather Operations Center Geospatial Analytics engine](https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite/geospatial-analytics)

At the end of the challenge, we will expect from each team a brief 3 minute video detailing what you’ve created, a description for how you put it all together and who your project is intended to help, and a roadmap to show the judges where your project is going.

## Judging

The solutions should be such that they can be extended and expanded upon. You will be judged based on:
- Completeness and transferability
- Effectiveness and efficiency - positive impact to science or scientific research
- Design and usability
- Creativity and innovation

## Building for users

Make sure you have a clear user in mind! Your solution should provide users with information, recommendations and insights that are relevant to them and how climate change is impacting their community.

Examples include:
- Agricultural workers
- Fishing industry
- Low-income communities (lack of local resources, greater economic instability)
- General civilian population
