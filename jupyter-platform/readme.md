# Welcome to the CFC Research Challenge - Jupyter Environment


Our jupyter notebook environement is available at [ibm.biz/cfcnotebook](http://ibm.biz/cfcnotebook).  A set of step-by-step instructions on how to access the environment are available [here](https://github.com/academic-initiative/research-challenge-2021/blob/main/jupyter-platform/how-to-access.md)

We'll start with a very quick tour of the Jupyter Interface for those who may not be familiar with JupyterHub.  The Jupyter Environment is made of two primary components.  The main editing window

And the file navigation area where you can upload, rename, copy, delete the files you are working with.
