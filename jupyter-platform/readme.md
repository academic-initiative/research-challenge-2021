# Welcome to the CFC Research Challenge - Jupyter Environment


Our jupyter notebook environement is available at [ibm.biz/cfcnotebook](http://ibm.biz/cfcnotebook).  A set of step-by-step instructions on how to access the environment are available [here](https://github.com/academic-initiative/research-challenge-2021/blob/main/jupyter-platform/how-to-access.md)

We'll start with a very quick tour of the Jupyter Interface for those who may not be familiar with JupyterHub.  The Jupyter Environment is made of two primary components.  The main editing window
